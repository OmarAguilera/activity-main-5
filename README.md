# odoo excercise by Omar Silva Aguilera
This is the Odoo's exercise (final version). You can see the site on action directly here: Thank you :) The comments and feedback about the mockup are in this same repository in the comments.txt file. 
But also on the readme file. Thank you ;)


First of all thank you for the opportunity, your support and your time for reviewing this work. 
I have made it with love and passion.

The indications of this activity, some observations were requested regarding the design. 
So the questions were:

What do you find good/bad in this mock-up? 
What would you improve?
What would you change?


I've seen some beautiful design patterns here and I've actually opted to keep most of the design at 992px and above.

However, I would propose redesigning a part of the page to make it more dynamic, (maybe using the proximity Gestalt's principle). I have called the section im talking about as "Highlights section" (The one 
that contains the information about tools, features, technology and easy to install).

I feel like it's a bit symmetrical and we could add more dynamism to it by alternating the pattern.
We could also change the background, even with small changes in tone to create the effect of visual separators for each element. 


Also adding interactivity or animations could work to keep the user's atention. At the end of the day, we want the user to get they need to take the next step.

And thats how i reachead the last point of my comments: Call to action buttons.
At the very bottom of the website, there are a couple of buttons that can be recognized as CTAs "Buy now" and "learn more". (just below the text "I want to start a new project), but just a few centimeters below, 
in the footer, the user will find two more buttons that have the same size ratio and even colors. If you ask me, form the point of view of the user this might confuse the user a bit, 
as i don't see the hierarchy principle being applied specifically in these buttons/zone. In the eyes of the user it is most likely that Buy now, Documentation and Purchase now are equally important and at
the end it will not be clear where to go first.
In the case there are two buttons supposed to go to the same place it is not worth repeating them unless there is some distance between them.

Well, thats all :) Thanks a lot for reading!

    Sincerely, Omar Silva Aguilera.
